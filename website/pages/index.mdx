# Pothos GraphQL (formerly GiraphQL) - 

Pothos is a plugin based GraphQL schema builder for typescript.

It makes writing graphql schemas in typescript easy, fast and enjoyable. The core of Pothos adds
0 overhead at runtime, and has `graphql` as its only dependency.

By leaning heavily on typescripts ability to infer types, Pothos is the most type-safe way of
writing GraphQL schemas in typescript/node while requiring very few manual type definitions and no
code generation.

Pothos has a unique and powerful plugin system that makes every plugin feel like its features are
built into the core library. Plugins can extend almost any part of the API by adding new options or
methods that can take full advantage of the Pothos type system.

## Hello, World

```javascript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder({});

builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    hello: t.string({
      args: {
        name: t.arg.string(),
      },
      resolve: (parent, { name }) => `hello, ${name || 'World'}`,
    }),
  }),
});

new ApolloServer({
  schema: builder.toSchema({}),
}).listen(3000);
```
