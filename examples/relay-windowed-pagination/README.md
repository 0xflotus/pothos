# A relay compatible GraphQL API that uses windowed pagination

This is roughly based on https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/01/21/graphql-relay-windowed-pagination/

This example uses the following packages:

- `@pothos/core`: For building the schema
- `@pothos/plugin-relay`: For adding relay compatible connections and nodes
- `graphql-yoga`: For creating a server that executes the schema

## Schema

```graphql

```
